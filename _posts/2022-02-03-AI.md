## LYMPHA app

Machine learning is usually seen as a future magic solution where data is inserted into a computer. Somehow this will cause the patient to become healthy. Exactly how machine learning can benefit the patient is a difficult question. Some important experimental areas of use are currently the elaboration of new algorithms in the form of flowcharts as well as radiology. In order for machine learning to be used in the day-to-day work of healthcare, a language is needed that is used in the communication from computer to the healthcare professional. Therefore, I also plan to develop LYMPHA in the direction of computers being able to build AI scripts in the language.
