## Lympha app

The shortage of health care professionals that I have mentioned before ([Patient autonomy and medical algorithms](https://rickardhultgren.github.io/lymphablog/2021/12/09/Patient_autonomy_and_medical_algorithms.html)) affects mainly the low-middle income countries. In these settings, low-cost phones and tablets, typically Android, are the deployment platforms of choice. 

One of the key concerns in these settings is severe skills shortages, where technology can be used to help empower lesser tiered workers. Therefore I develop an Android app for reeding what medical procedures would be appropriate to execute in a certain situation.

The app is in a rough alpha stage, but I hope you can get an idea of how the final app should work. The app reads a LYMPHA script. There i an examle script inside the program with two nodes: *crepitation* and *antibiotics*. When you start the app reads the script and then this will be shown on your screen:

When you click the *OK* button you will get this screen:

Do you want to test the current version? Then just download Kivy:
