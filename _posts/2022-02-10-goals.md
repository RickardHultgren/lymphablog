## Goals/To-do-list

Before any further develpment of lymphaonline or the lymphaapp, the interpreter that is the core of every other application has to be improved:

 - Debugging.
 - Making every kind of patient-data-evalution work.
 - Rewrite the regex-recognition and update the lexer function.
 - Developing example scripts for stroke and myocardial infarction. Making sure that they work without bugs both on the CLI and web project.
 - Update the pip-version.
 - Improve how userfriendly the CLI-project is.
